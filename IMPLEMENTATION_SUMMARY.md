# Implementation Summary: .crec File Backup Feature

## Issue Description
**Original Issue (Japanese)**: コレクションのバックアップ作成時に、プロジェクト設定ファイル（.crec）もアップデートする。

**Translation**: When creating a collection backup, also update (backup) the project settings file (.crec).

## Requirements Implemented

1. ✅ Create a folder named `$ProjectSettingFileBackup` within the project backup folder
2. ✅ Backup filename format: `backup creation datetime + original project settings filename`
3. ✅ Always backup after saving the project settings file
4. ✅ When creating a collection backup, if no project settings backup exists, create one
5. ✅ Match the number of backups to MaxBackupCount setting and delete old backups when exceeded

## Changes Made

### 1. CollectionDataClass.cs
**Added Constants:**
- `ProjectSettingFileBackupFolderName = "$ProjectSettingFileBackup"`

**New Methods:**
- `BackupProjectSettingFile()`: Creates a backup of the project settings file
- `ManageProjectSettingBackupCount()`: Manages backup count and deletes old backups

**Modified Methods:**
- `BackupProjectData()`: Now checks if project settings backup exists; if not, creates one
- `CleanupDeletedCollectionBackupFolders()`: Excludes `$ProjectSettingFileBackup` from cleanup

### 2. ProjectSettingClass.cs
**Modified Methods:**
- `SaveProjectSetting()`: Now calls `BackupProjectSettingFile()` after successful save

## Technical Details

### Backup Process
1. **Automatic Trigger**: Backup occurs automatically after each successful project settings save
2. **Folder Creation**: Creates `$ProjectSettingFileBackup` folder in the project backup directory
3. **File Naming**: Uses format `yyyyMMdd_HHmmssfff_<original_filename>.crec`
4. **Count Management**: Maintains up to `MaxBackupCount` backups, deleting oldest when exceeded

### Error Handling
- Backup failures are logged but don't interrupt user workflow (silent failure)
- Project settings save operation succeeds independently of backup success
- Errors are written to debug output for troubleshooting

### Thread Safety
- Backup operations are thread-safe for concurrent collection backups
- SaveProjectSetting backup is synchronous and sequential

## Files Changed
1. `Code/CREC/CollectionDataClass.cs` (+135 lines, -2 lines)
2. `Code/CREC/ProjectSettingClass.cs` (+7 lines)

## Documentation Added
1. `TESTING_GUIDE_PROJECT_SETTINGS_BACKUP.md` - Comprehensive testing guide
2. `IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY_JA.md` - Japanese implementation summary
3. `BACKUP_FLOW_DIAGRAM.md` - Visual flow diagrams

## Testing Requirements

### Manual Testing Required
Since this is a Windows-only application, the following must be tested on Windows:

1. **Basic Functionality**
   - Verify backup folder creation
   - Verify backup file naming convention
   - Verify automatic backup after save

2. **Count Management**
   - Test MaxBackupCount enforcement
   - Test old backup deletion
   - Test count adjustment when MaxBackupCount changes

3. **Integration**
   - Test collection backup integration
   - Test cleanup operation exclusion
   - Test multiple projects isolation

4. **Error Cases**
   - Test with read-only backup folder
   - Test with insufficient disk space
   - Test with invalid paths

See `TESTING_GUIDE_PROJECT_SETTINGS_BACKUP.md` for detailed test scenarios.

## Compatibility

- **Windows**: ✅ Compatible (Windows 10/11, Windows Server 2016+)
- **Linux/macOS**: ❌ Not compatible (Windows-only application)
- **.NET Framework**: 4.8 required
- **Visual Studio**: 2019 or newer for building

## Known Limitations

1. **No Compression**: Project settings backups are stored uncompressed (unlike collection backups which support ZIP)
2. **No Restore UI**: Users must manually restore from backup folder via file system
3. **No Differential Backups**: Full copy created each time (no incremental backups)
4. **Silent Errors**: Backup failures are not shown to users (logged only)

## Future Enhancement Ideas

1. Add compression option for project settings backups
2. Add UI for restoring project settings from backups
3. Add user notification option for backup failures
4. Implement differential/incremental backups
5. Add backup status indicator in UI

## Backward Compatibility

- ✅ Existing projects continue to work without modification
- ✅ Existing collection backup functionality unchanged
- ✅ Existing MaxBackupCount setting applies to both collection and project settings backups
- ✅ No database migrations or data conversions required

## Build Status

⚠️ **Note**: This implementation cannot be built or tested on Linux/macOS due to Windows-specific dependencies. Building requires:
- Windows 10/11 or Windows Server 2016+
- Visual Studio 2019 or newer
- .NET Framework 4.8 Developer Pack

## Review Checklist

- [x] All requirements from issue implemented
- [x] Code follows existing project patterns
- [x] Error handling implemented appropriately
- [x] No breaking changes to existing functionality
- [x] Documentation provided (English and Japanese)
- [x] Test scenarios documented
- [ ] Manual testing on Windows (pending)

## Deployment

To deploy this feature:
1. Build the solution in Visual Studio on Windows
2. Test using the scenarios in TESTING_GUIDE_PROJECT_SETTINGS_BACKUP.md
3. Deploy CREC.exe to production/distribution
4. Inform users about the new automatic backup feature
